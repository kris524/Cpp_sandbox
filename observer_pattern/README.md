Practice Question: Implement an Online Auction System

Imagine you are tasked with implementing an online auction system in C++ using the Observer design pattern. In this system, there are two types of entities: Auctioneers and Bidders.

Auctioneers are responsible for starting and managing auctions.
Bidders can participate in auctions by placing bids on items.
Your task is to implement the Observer pattern to notify bidders when an auction they are interested in starts or when a new bid is placed.

Requirements:

Create classes for Auctioneer and Bidder.
The Auctioneer class should be able to:
Start an auction for a specific item.
Accept bids from bidders for the auctioned item.
Notify all registered bidders when a new bid is placed or when the auction starts.
The Bidder class should be able to:
Register interest in specific auctions.
Receive notifications when an auction they are interested in starts or when a new bid is placed.
Place bids on items in ongoing auctions.
Implement the Observer pattern to ensure that bidders are notified of changes in the auction system. Use appropriate data structures and mechanisms to manage the list of bidders interested in each auction.

Write a C++ program that demonstrates the functionality of the online auction system. Create instances of auctioneers and bidders, start auctions, register bidders for auctions, and place bids. Ensure that the observers (bidders) are properly notified of relevant events.

Feel free to add additional features or details to make your implementation more comprehensive and interesting.

This practice question will help you apply the Observer pattern in C++ and gain a better understanding of how to implement it in a real-world scenario.
