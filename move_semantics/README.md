Exercise: Resource Management with the Rule of Three

Create a C++ class called DynamicArray to manage a dynamically allocated integer array. Implement the Rule of Three by providing the following functions:

Constructor: A constructor that takes the size of the array and allocates memory for it.

Copy Constructor: A copy constructor that performs a deep copy of the array when a new DynamicArray object is created from an existing one.

Copy Assignment Operator: A copy assignment operator that allows one DynamicArray object to be assigned the value of another, performing a deep copy.

Destructor: A destructor that deallocates the dynamically allocated memory.

Print Function: A member function that prints the elements of the array.
