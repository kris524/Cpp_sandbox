Project idea: Todo List Manager

Description: Create a command-line application that allows users to manage their todo list. The application should provide the following functionalities:

1. Add a new task: Users can add a new task to their todo list, including a title, description, and due date.
View all tasks: Users can view all the tasks in their todo list, including their details.
2. Mark task as complete: Users can mark a task as complete and update its status.
3. Remove a task: Users can remove a task from their todo list.
4. Save and load tasks: Implement the ability to save and load the todo list from a file, allowing users to persist their tasks between application runs.
5. You can enhance the project by adding more features such as task prioritization, task categories, searching tasks, and providing a user-friendly interface with menus and options.

This project will allow you to practice various aspects of C++, including working with classes, data structures, file I/O, string manipulation, and user input handling. It will also give you an opportunity to design and implement a small-scale application from scratch.

Remember to break down the project into smaller tasks, plan your code structure, and test your application thoroughly. Happy coding!
