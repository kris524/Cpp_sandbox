Project Idea: File Encryption/Decryption Tool

Description: Create a C++ command-line application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using a simple encryption algorithm. The application should provide the following functionalities:

File Encryption: Users can encrypt a file using a chosen encryption key. The program should read the content of the input file, apply the encryption algorithm to each character, and write the encrypted content to a new output file.

File Decryption: Users can decrypt an encrypted file using the same encryption key. The program should read the encrypted content from the input file, apply the decryption algorithm to each character, and write the decrypted content to a new output file.

Customizable Encryption Algorithm: Allow users to choose a simple encryption algorithm, such as Caesar cipher or XOR-based encryption. You can prompt the user to enter the encryption key or generate it randomly.

Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for cases like incorrect file paths, invalid encryption keys, or unsuccessful file operations.

User-Friendly Interface: Create a menu-driven interface with clear instructions and options for encryption and decryption. Make the application easy to use and understand.

This project will give you the opportunity to work with file I/O, string manipulation, user input handling, and basic encryption techniques. Additionally, you can explore different encryption algorithms and experiment with improving their security. Remember to test your application thoroughly with different files and encryption keys to ensure its reliability and functionality. Happy coding!
